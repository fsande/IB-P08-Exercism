# Lab assignment (lab, class presentation with slides) structure

This directory is organised as follows:
 ```     
   ├── docs               # All kind of project documentation files
   ├── .gitignore         # Hiden .gitignore file for your source code programming language
   ├── img                # Image resources if needed
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── README.md          # This file
   ├── src                # Source code
   └── tests              # Source code for tests, if included
```
For each assignment there should be a markdown file with the assignment description.
Find that file and follow the instructions on it.

**Before** the evaluation session of the assignment, **do not forget** to upload the (git) link to your repository to the Moodle classroom.
**Remember also** to remove all empty directories in the final version of the project
